# Age Detection using Deep Learning

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict a person's age from their facial image. Age prediction has numerous applications in various fields, such as security, marketing, and human-computer interaction. However, building an accurate age prediction model can be challenging due to the complex nature of facial features and the impact of various factors like ethnicity, gender, and environmental conditions on facial appearance.

### Dataset
We are using an external dataset, collected from a programming challenge that I competed on. The dataset consists of 4000 images of people's faces, including 3000 labelled and 1000 unlabelled images. 

**We deliberately used less images to train the machine learning models on our laptop, instead of using a dedicated GPU**

To train our model, we used 2700 images (90% of the training set) for training and 300 images (10% of the training set) for validation. 

### Technologies used
1. Python
2. Data Science Stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
3. Pytorch for implementing deep learning models
4. Other libraries (wget, zipfile) for data download and extraction

### Methodology

To tackle this problem, we employ deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have proven to be effective in computer vision tasks. The methodology can be divided into the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: The first step involves obtaining a dataset of facial images labeled with the corresponding ages. In this project, we use a dataset provided by an external source, which includes a training set and a test set, comprising a total of 4000 images.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw image data needs to be preprocessed before being fed into the neural network. This involves converting the images to a consistent size and format, as well as applying necessary transformations like normalization.
3. **Model Architecture**: We define a CNN architecture tailored for the age prediction task. The architecture consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for age prediction.
4. **Model Training**: The model is trained on the preprocessed training data using an optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam optimizer) and a suitable loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error). During training, the model learns to map the facial features to the corresponding age labels.
5. **Model Evaluation**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, which was held out during the training process. Evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), are calculated to assess the model's accuracy.
5. **Model Deployment**: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed for age prediction on new, unseen facial images.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, for the age prediction task. By leveraging a labeled dataset of facial images and implementing a suitable CNN architecture, we were able to train a model that can predict a person's age with reasonable accuracy.

**In our case, the accurary of the model isn't very good, which could be attributed to the limited set of 3000 training images of which we used 2700 for training and 300 for testing. Using a larger and more diverse dataset could yield potentially better results** 

However, it's important to note that age prediction is a complex problem, and the model's performance may be influenced by various factors, such as the diversity of the training data, the quality of the images, and the presence of biases in the dataset. Additionally, ethical considerations regarding privacy and fairness should be taken into account when deploying such models in real-world applications.

Overall, this project provides a solid foundation for further research and improvements in age prediction models, as well as potential applications in related domains, such as facial recognition, demographic analysis, and personalized services.
